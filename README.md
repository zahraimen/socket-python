# Project Title

This is a chat bot project that uses socket technology and Python programming language

## Appendix

This project is made of two parts, application and backend.  [Qt designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtdesigner-manual.html) is used for the application of this project, whose code structure is implemented in 2 functions: setupUi, and retranslateUi.
But for the back-end part of our project, we used the [websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library, whose codes can be seen inside the sendKey function.
